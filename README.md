# elixir_common_i18n

Common Gettext localization / internationalization strings for Elixir applications - for example, for usage with [Gettext](https://hexdocs.pm/gettext/Gettext.html).

These include transations of strings like Ecto's "can't be blank" error.

Contributions and corrections are welcome!
